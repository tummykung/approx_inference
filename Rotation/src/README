Inference Type
==============
0 = Exact
1 = Approximate inference by
	- only sampling the model expectation
2 = Importance sampling by
	- sampling the model expectation, use the importance weight
	  to correct target sampling. However, still use exact inference
	  to compute the importance weight.
3 = Normalized importance sampling by
	- using the model weight as the proposal distribution
